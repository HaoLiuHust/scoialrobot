= Introduction =

In this page we give a step by step how to install and use our programmes.

= Download and compilation =

Download the source code from our SVN:

{{{
  svn checkout http://scoialrobot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ scoialrobot-read-only
}}}

Navigate to the folder of social robot:

{{{
  roscd social_robot
}}}

And compile the project:

{{{
  rosmake
}}}

This creates number of executable files that you can use, we have explained each of them one by one.

= Usage =

After you have compiled our project you can run any of the following executables files.

== ROS Topics ==

=== Social Robot RGB ===

This module is dependant on _roscore_ and subscribes to Kinect RGB images, so as prerequisite you have to make sure they're running

{{{
  roscore
  roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
}}}

Please note that instead _real_ Kinect you can use _.oni_ files as virtual Kinect. We have explained it further down how to do it.

Run the topic:

{{{
  rosrun social_robot social_robot_rgb
}}}

You can use this module as you wish, the detected faces are published. You can subscribe to them and use them as you wish.

=== Social Robot Depth ===

Similar to above, we need _roscore_ and Kinect images.

Run the topic:

{{{
  rosrun social_robot social_robot_depth
}}}

You can use this module as you wish, the detected faces are published. You can subscribe to them and use them as you wish.

=== Social Robot Track ===

Similar to above, we need _roscore_ and Kinect images.

This module can be run either as stand alone application, it performs detection and tracking together. However this is not advised, since it will be very slow and the performance wont be very good. If you still wish you run it as standalone do as follow:

{{{
  rosrun social_robot social_robot -s -d -c
}}}

For further understanding of the passed arguments please refer to our [http://scoialrobot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/social_robot/documentation/html/index.html documentation].
