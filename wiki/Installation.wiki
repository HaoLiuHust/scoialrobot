= Introduction =

In this page we give a step by step how to install and use our programmes.

= Download and compilation =

Download the source code from our SVN:

{{{
  svn checkout http://scoialrobot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ scoialrobot-read-only
}}}

Navigate to the folder of social robot:

{{{
  roscd social_robot
}}}

And compile the project:

{{{
  rosmake
}}}

This creates number of executable files that you can use, we have explained each of them one by one.

= Usage =

After you have compiled our project you can run any of the following executables files.

== ROS Topics ==

=== Social Robot RGB ===

This module is dependant on _roscore_ and subscribes to Kinect RGB images, so as prerequisite you have to make sure they're running

{{{
  roscore
  roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
}}}

Please note that instead _real_ Kinect you can use _.oni_ files as virtual Kinect. We have explained it further down how to do it.

Run the topic:

{{{
  rosrun social_robot social_robot_rgb
}}}

You can use this module as you wish, the detected faces are published. You can subscribe to them and use them as you wish.

=== Social Robot Depth ===

Similar to above, we need _roscore_ and Kinect images.

{{{
  roscore
  roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
}}}

Run the topic:

{{{
  rosrun social_robot social_robot_depth
}}}

You can use this module as you wish, the detected faces are published. You can subscribe to them and use them as you wish.
