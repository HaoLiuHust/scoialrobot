== Introduction ==
A social robot is defined as " an autonomous robot that interacts and communicates with humans or other autonomous physical agents by following social behaviors and rules attached to its role" Social robots need to understand and react intelligently to the actions and intentions of 
multiple humans in a visual scene.

This project will combine a NAO torso with a Kinect controller to try to estimate the social scene in a bar/pub/caf√© style interaction with multiple users. The main work in the project will be in vision: using the NAO and Kinect to track multiple humans and perform gesture recognition and gaze estimation. A particular focus will be on detecting when humans want attention from the robot.
