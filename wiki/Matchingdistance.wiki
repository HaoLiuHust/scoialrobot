= 2D Chamfer Distance Matching =

= Introduction =

= Description =

The steps followed for computing 2D Chamfer Distance Matching are:
  # Calculate edge image.
  # Compute distances between pixel and the closest edge to it.
  # Calculate different scales for the resulting distance image.
  # Match the template with all the scale images.
  # Use a threshold in order to get the best matches.

== Edge image ==

For this step it has been chosen Canny algorithm. The two thresholds used are 5 and 7.

== Distance image ==

The Euclidean distance has been chosen for this step.

== Distance image pyramid ==

The number of scales depends on the depth range, even though the maximum number of computed scales will be 5.

The scale factor used is 3/4.

== Matching with the template ==

The template used for the matching

It will be matched with all the scale images and a threshold will be used in order to keep the best results. A high threshold has been chosen 10, to reduce as much as possible the number of false negatives.
