= 2D Chamfer Distance Matching =

= Introduction =

= Description =

The steps followed for computing 2D Chamfer Distance Matching are:
  * Calculate edge image.
  * Compute distances between pixel and the closest edge to it.
  * Calculate different scales for the resulting distance image.
  * Match the template with all the scale images.
  * Use a threshold in order to get the best matches.
