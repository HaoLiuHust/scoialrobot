Project plan of project

= Overview =
We're following the "Human Detection Using Depth Information by Kinect" paper. The project is broken down into the following steps:

== Calibrating the camera ==
Using chess board to calibration, to be done by *week 42*. 

== Obtaining the input image from Kinect  ==
Reading images from Kinect. It's *done*.

== Perform preprossing ==
Noise removal with median filter. It's *done*.

== 2D chamfer distance matching ==
To get the edge information embedded in the depth array to locate the possible regions that may indicate the appearance of a person. To be done by *week 42*.

== Calculating parameters of the head ==
In order to generate the 3D model to fit on the depth array. To be done by *week 43*.

== Generating 3D model and fitting ==
To be done by *week 43*.

== Separating human from its background ==
Region growing segmentation. To be done by *week 44*.

== Extracting whole contour of human ==
Extracting the contours of the person to be used later on in tracking. To be done by *week 44*

== Tracking ==
To be done by *week 45*.

== Experiment and modification ==
Week 46 - 48.
