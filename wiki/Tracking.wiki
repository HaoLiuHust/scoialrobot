= Tracking =

== Introduction ==
This part presents the tracking implementation of our project. We have started with a simple tracking algorithm based on background subtraction and motion estimation. Based on the real requirements of the project, the proposed algorithm failed in a large number of cases and a more stable algorithm was needed: particle filter. In the next sections short details of both algorithms will be presented.

== Background subtraction ==
The algorithm is based on subtraction between each frame and background. Due to the fact that the robot was supposed to be placed in a bar, with highly changeable background, the reference frame known as background, is update from time to time in order to keep a stable algorithm.
