= Introduction =
This part presents the tracking implementation of our project. We have started with a simple tracking algorithm based on background subtraction and motion estimation. Based on the real requirements of the project, the proposed algorithm failed in a large number of cases and a more stable algorithm was needed: particle filter. In the next sections short details of both algorithms will be presented.
