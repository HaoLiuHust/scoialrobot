= Tracking =

== Introduction ==
This part presents the tracking implementation of our project. We have started with a simple tracking algorithm based on background subtraction and motion estimation. Based on the real requirements of the project, the proposed algorithm failed in a large number of cases and a more stable algorithm was needed: particle filter. In the next sections short details of both algorithms will be presented.

== Background subtraction and Motion estimation ==
The algorithm is based on subtraction between each frame and background. Due to the fact that the robot was supposed to be placed in a bar, with highly changeable background, the reference frame known as background, is update from time to time in order to keep a stable algorithm.

=== Algorithm: === 

*1. Background subtraction*
     In order to make the system more stable and to estimate the motion, we have used both the difference between the current frame and the background and the difference between current and previous frame.
   {{{
    for ALL frames:
       Mask = previous_frame - background 
       Current_frame = Current_frame * Mask
    end
}}}


*2. Candidate object identification*
    In this part the candidates are located based on the difference image, that is first thresholded. The candidates will be represented by bounding boxes obtained after finding the connected components from the binary image. A threshold is used in order to keep only the most important bounding boxes.
   
*3. Target object selection*
